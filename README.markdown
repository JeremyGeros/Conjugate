[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/JeremyGeros/Conjugate.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/JeremyGeros/Conjugate)

Conjugates verbs into their proper form given a pronoun. Can conjugate irregular verbs that are in this list https://gist.github.com/1841995
Currently only has support for Spanish.

```
Conjugate::Spanish.conjugate(:pronoun => :yo, :verb => 'tener')
=> tengo
```
Can also pass tenses

```
Conjugate::Spanish.conjugate(:pronoun => :yo, :verb => 'tener', :tense => :past)
=> tuve
```

Also now works for French 

```
Conjugate::French.conjugate(:pronoun => :je, :verb => 'acheter', :tense => :present)
=> achÃ¨te
```

There is also a helper method to pass a language option, either the name or language code
```
Conjugate.conjugate({language: 'french', verb: 'jouer', tense: :present, pronoun: :je})
=> joue

Conjugate.conjugate({language: 'fr', verb: 'jouer', tense: :present, pronoun: :je})
=> joue

Conjugate.conjugate({language: 'spanish', verb: 'comprar', tense: :present, pronoun: :yo})
=> compro

Conjugate.conjugate({language: 'es', verb: 'comprar', tense: :present, pronoun: :yo})
=> compro
```
